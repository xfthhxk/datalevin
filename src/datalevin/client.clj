  The following can be set in the optional map:
  * `:pool-size` determines number of connections maintained in the connection
  pool, default is 3.
  * `:time-out` specifies the time (milliseconds) before an exception is thrown
  when obtaining an open network connection, default is 60000.
  * `:ha-write-retry-timeout-ms` bounds extra HA failover retry time after a
  retryable write rejection. By default it is derived from HA lease/promotion
  timing and capped by `:time-out`.
  * `:ha-write-retry-delay-ms` sleeps between HA failover retry rounds,
