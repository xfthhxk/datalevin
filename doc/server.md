# Datalevin Server/Client

## Usage

Using the same native command line tool, `dtlv serv` will run in the server mode
and accepts network connections on `127.0.0.1:8898` by default.

* Use option `--host` to specify the address that the server listens on. The
  default is `127.0.0.1`. Binding to a non-loopback address, such as
  `0.0.0.0`, requires setting `DATALEVIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`.
* Use option `-p` to specify an alternative port number that the server listens
  to. Proper firewall settings is needed to allow remote access to the port.
* `-r` option can be used to specify a root directory path on the server, where
  all data reside under. The default path is `/var/lib/datalevin` on Posix
  systems, `C:\ProgramData\Datalevin` on Windows. User should
  make sure read/write file permissions are set on the directory path for the
  user running the server.
* `-v` option enables verbose server debug logs. Datalevin server writes logs to
  stdout.

Although `dtlv` command line tool starts up fast and use less memory, it may not
be suitable for highly concurrent and demanding use cases. The reason is that
the community version of GraalVM that `dtlv` native command tool is built with
uses only SerialGC, which limits the application throughout greatly. For such
use cases, it is recommended to run the JVM version of Datalevin as the server,
e.g. run this command:

```
DATALEVIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=secret java --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED -jar datalevin-0.9.10-standalone.jar serv --host 0.0.0.0 -v -r /data/dtlv
```

The JVM version of Datalevin may use more memory, but it supports much higher
throughout, is more suitable as a long running process, and the usual JVM
monitoring tools can also be leveraged.

The user is recommended to run the server process as a daemon or service using
the preferred operation system tools, e.g. systemd on Linux, Launch Daemon on
MacOS, or sc.exe on Windows. Packagers are welcomed to package Datalevin server
on the preferred platforms.

There is a default builtin user `datalevin` with a default password `datalevin`.
This is a system account that can do everything on the server. The default
password can be changed by passing in a `DATALEVIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` environment
variable when starting the server. This environment variable is required when
binding the server to a non-loopback address. Another option is to set it on the
REPL or in code:

1. Start the server, maybe as a sudo user, to access the default data root directory
```console
# dtlv serv
```
2. Start Datalevin REPL in another terminal
```console
$ dtlv
```
3. Type the following in the REPL

```console
user> (def client (new-client "dtlv://datalevin:datalevin@localhost"))
#'user/client
user> (reset-password client "datalevin" "new-password")
nil
```

It is suggested to create different users for access to the server (see below).
Leave the `datalevin` user for server administration purpose only.

For remote access, username and password is required on the connection URI. Make
sure username and password are URL encoded strings on the URI.

When a client (for now, just the Datalevin library itself) opens a Datalevin database
using a connection URI, i.e.
`dtlv://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<db-name>?store=datalog|kv`,
instead of a local path name, a connection to the server is attempted.

`db-name` should be unique on the server. `store` parameter is optional, default
is `datalog`, the other option is `kv` for key-value store. A database will be
created if it does not yet exist. `port` is optional, default is `8898`.

If you are using both the `datalog` store and the `kv` store on the same server, these are two different databases
and thus must have different names. The `db-name` cannot be the same for the `datalog` store and
the `kv` store running within one datalevin server instance. In fact, `db-name`
must be unique across the whole server.

The same functions for local databases work on the remote databases, i.e. any
function that takes a `dir` argument can also take a connection URI string,
e.g. `(get-conn "dtlv://datalevin:datalevin@localhost/mydb")`. The remote access
is transparent to the function callers.

## Implementation

The client/server mode is enabled with little changes to the Datalevin core library.

### Architecture

As mentioned, the main design criteria is to have transparent remote databases
access that has the same API as local databases. This is achieved by building a
remote access layer to proxy the database storage. Each local storage access function
has a corresponding proxy function that performs remote storage access over the
wire. That is to say, the local and remote storage present exactly the same
interface to the higher level callers.

Compared with traditional client/server architecture, where the server performs
all the actual data processing work, the architecture of Datalevin enable easier
implementation of rich user convenience features. For much of the high level
functionalities sit on top of storage, such as caching, transaction data
preparation, query parse, change listening, and so on, they are handled on
the client side, which is the same as in the local embedded mode. For example,
our recent added feature of [transactable
entity](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin#entities-with-staged-transactions-datalog-store) works the same in
either embedded or server mode, without needing any code changes.

Compared with the peer architecture of Datomic®, where peers receive all the
data, Datalevin clients requests only the needed data on demand. The amount of
network traffic is reduced, clients are simpler than peers and have less work to
do, so the impact on the user application performance is minimized. Because not
all the data are duplicated on all the peers, the size of the database only
depends on the capacity of the server, which can afford to be a beefy machine.

In Datalevin client/server mode, transaction and querying can happen both in
client and server side, depending on the context. For example, for queries
having a single remote data source, the entire query processing is done remotely
to save networking traffic. For other cases, only low level data access
functions are handled on the server.

By default, each client checks `last-modified` time of the remote database
before data access, so when multiple clients are accessing the same database on
the server, all see the same most update-to-date data, as long as the clients
and the server have clock synchronization, which is a mild condition that most
modern server deployment environment should meet, with ntp or chrony services
being part of the standard server environment. In term of CAP theorem,
Datalevin favors consistency over availability, in consistent with our goal of
simplifying data access.

All these are transparent to the users and the same data access API works for
all cases.  Further optimizations can be implemented behind the scene
without having to introduce new operational complexities.

### Tuning knobs

Most deployments work well with defaults, but these knobs control common
latency/throughput trade-offs.

#### Client cache freshness vs remote round trips

`datalevin.constants/*remote-db-last-modified-check-interval-ms*` (default
`0`) sets the minimum interval between remote `last-modified` checks performed
by `db?`.

* `0` means check on every call (strict freshness, more network round trips).
* A positive value reuses the previous freshness check inside the interval
  (fewer round trips, but remote updates may be observed later, up to the
  interval).

Example:

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.constants :as c]
         '[datalevin.core :as d])

(binding [c/*remote-db-last-modified-check-interval-ms* 250]
  (d/get-conn "dtlv://user:pass@db-host:8898/app"))
```

#### Client connection pool

`datalevin.client/new-client` accepts:

* `:pool-size` (default `3`): max pooled connections per client instance.
* `:time-out` (default `60000` ms): timeout for getting a connection and for
  retrying requests.
* `:ha-write-retry-timeout-ms` (default `min(:time-out, 17000)` with current HA
  defaults): extra wall clock budget for retryable HA write failover after an
  endpoint rejects a write because leadership changed. The default is derived
  from HA lease timeout and promotion timing, rather than being a fixed 5s.
* `:ha-write-retry-delay-ms` (default `100` ms): sleep between HA write retry
  rounds.

Example:

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.client :as cl])

(def client
  (cl/new-client "dtlv://user:pass@db-host:8898"
                 {:pool-size 12
                  :time-out 120000
                  :ha-write-retry-timeout-ms 8000
                  :ha-write-retry-delay-ms 150}))
```

#### HA write failover

In HA deployments, ordinary write requests use bounded automatic failover:

* if a node quickly replies with a retryable HA write rejection such as
  `:not-leader`, the client immediately moves on to the next known endpoint
* after probing the current endpoint set once, the client can retry the same
  set in later rounds, sleeping at least `:ha-write-retry-delay-ms` between
  rounds
* retryable HA rejections may also carry an internal `:ha-retry-after-ms` hint;
  the client treats that as a per-round minimum delay when it is larger than
  the configured base delay
* the whole retry process stops once a write succeeds or the extra
  `:ha-write-retry-timeout-ms` budget is exhausted

This matters because leader failover is not usually instantaneous. The
control-plane defaults are already in the seconds range, so a client may need a
short bounded retry window to ride through election and promotion convergence.

The automatic HA retry path applies to ordinary one-shot writes, and also to
opening explicit remote write transactions. `open-transact` /
`open-transact-kv` can retry across known HA endpoints until a leader accepts
the open request. Once the transaction session is opened, however, it stays
bound to that server connection and is not automatically migrated to a new
leader mid-transaction.

#### HA replica reads

In HA deployments, a client can read from a replica/follower by connecting to
that node's endpoint with the normal client APIs. There is currently no
separate "read-only replica client" API or URI flag.

For example, both of the following are valid ways to read from a replica:

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.client :as cl]
         '[datalevin.core :as d])

(def client
  (cl/new-client "dtlv://user:pass@replica-host:8898"))

(def conn
  (d/create-conn "dtlv://user:pass@replica-host:8898/app"))
```

The existing client is sufficient for replica reads. In HA mode, write
operations may be retried or routed to the authoritative leader. Ordinary read
requests remain follower-eligible, and if the connected node becomes
unreachable, the client can retry the read against other known HA endpoints for
that database. A successful failover read may therefore be served by a follower
rather than the former leader.

If you need enforced read-only access, use RBAC rather than a special client
type: grant the user or role only `:datalevin.server/view` permission on the
database, and do not grant `:datalevin.server/alter`,
`:datalevin.server/create`, or `:datalevin.server/control`.

#### Server idle session timeout

CLI option `--idle-timeout` (default `172800000` ms, i.e. 48 hours) controls
when inactive sessions are disconnected to reclaim resources.

```console
dtlv serv -r /data/dtlv --idle-timeout 3600000
```

#### Wire compression

These dynamic vars tune client/server protocol compression (zstd):

* `datalevin.constants/*wire-compression-threshold*` (default `8192` bytes):
  minimum payload size before attempting compression.
* `datalevin.constants/*wire-compression-level*` (default `3`): zstd
  compression level.

Lower threshold and higher level can reduce bandwidth at the cost of more CPU.
Set these on both client and server processes if you want symmetric behavior.

#### Runtime UDFs

Remote transaction UDFs run where the transaction executes: on the server.
Descriptor-backed `:db/udf` therefore requires server-side runtime setup.

Embedded/local databases can be opened with:

```clojure
{:runtime-opts {:udf-registry registry}}
```

In server mode, the equivalent runtime registry or resolver must be installed in
the server process when databases are opened or reopened. Client-local runtime
registries are not consulted for remote transaction execution.

Stored Clojure `:db/fn` transaction functions defined with `inter-fn` continue
to work as before. Non-Clojure or host-managed UDFs should use `:db/udf`, where
the database stores only a descriptor such as:

```clojure
{:udf/lang :java
 :udf/kind :tx-fn
 :udf/id   :user/bootstrap}
```

In HA deployments, optional runtime setting `:ha-require-udf-ready? true` makes
the leader reject writes until all installed `:db/udf` transaction descriptors
can be resolved by the server runtime.

At present, the standalone `dtlv serv` CLI does not provide a dedicated flag
for installing foreign-language registries, so non-Clojure server-side UDFs
need programmatic server setup.

### Networking

The server employs a non-blocking event driven architecture, so it can support a
large number of concurrent connected clients. The server event loop runs as a
single process. It accepts and segments incoming bytes from the network into
messages, then dispatches them to a work stealing thread pool to handle each
individual message.

Work stealing thread pool reduces lock contentions and maximizes the server CPU
utilization. Each thread processes its message and writes its own response back
to the network channel when it becomes ready, so the server message handling is
asynchronous. It is the client's responsibility to track request/response
correspondence if multiple messages are on the wire.

For developer convenience, the current implemented client in the library makes
synchronous and blocking network connections. For normal commands, it sends a
request and waits for the responses from the server, so the data access API is
the same for both the local databases and remote databases. In addition, the
client has a built-in connection pool, to reuse pre-established connections.

The wire protocol between server and client is largely inspired by the wire
protocol of PostgreSQL. It uses TLV message format, with 1 byte message type in
front, followed by 4 bytes message length, and concludes with the message
payload.

The payload format is extensible, indicated by
the message type byte. For example, with type `1`,
[transit+json](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format) encoded bytes will
be the payload. The default payload format is type `2`, using
[nippy](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy) serialization.

nippy format produces smaller bytes with faster speed, but it only works
with Clojure code. If a client needs to be written for other languages, transit
is a better choice. The server accepts either format just as well. Other format
may be added in the future if necessary.

The command messages are EDN maps, e.g. `{:type :list-databases :args []}`. The
command responses are also EDN maps. e.g. `{:type :command-complete :results
["mydb" "hr-db"]}`. For bulk data, the client/server switch to a direct
copy-in/copy-out sub-protocol, where data are continuously streamed. The
copy-in/copy-out data stream messages are batched data in EDN vectors
instead of maps.

Clojure transaction functions defined with `inter-fn` can be serialized and
sent to the server for execution. They are first evaluated in the sandbox using
a Clojure interpreter, i.e. [sci](https://github.com/borkdude/sci) based on a
white list. The serialized `inter-fn` sandbox does not allow host file I/O,
namespace mutation, dynamic eval/load, thread/agent APIs, or Java interop.
Descriptor-backed `:db/udf` works differently: only the descriptor crosses the
wire, and the server resolves it against its own runtime registry or resolver.

### Security

Datalevin server implements full-fledged role based access control (RBAC).
Permissions are granted to roles, and roles are assigned to users. User access
is secured by password.

A permission consists of three pieces of information:

* `:permission/act` indicates the permitted actions, and it can be one of
  `:datalevin.server/view`, `:datalevin.server/alter`,
  `:datalevin.server/create`, or `:datalevin.server/control`, in increasing
  level of privilege, and the latter implies the former.
* `:permission/obj` indicates the object type of the securable, and it can be
  one of `:datalevin.server/user`, `:datalevin.server/role`,
  `:datalevin.server/database`, or `:datalevin.server/server`, with the last one
  implies all others.
* `:permission/tgt` refers to the concrete target of the securable. It could be
  a username, a role keyword, a database name or `nil`, depending on
  `permission/obj`. All these target names uniquely identify securable objects.
  When the target is `nil`, the permission applies to all objects of that type.


Each user has a corresponding built-in unique role, with a role keyword
`:datalevin.role/<username>`. For example, the default user `datalevin`  has a
built-in role `:datalevin.role/datalevin`. This role is granted the permission
`{:permission/act :datalevin.server/control, :permission/obj
:datalevin.server/server}`, which permits the role to do everything on the
server.

In the command line REPL, after connecting to a server, issue `(create-user
...)` to create a user, `(create-role ...)` to create a role, `(assign-role
...)` to assign a role to a user, `(grant-permission ...)` to grant a permission
to a role.

User password is stored as a salt and a hash. The password hashing algorithm
takes the recommended more than 0.5 seconds to run on a modern server class
machine, so it can defeat a brutal force cracking effort.
